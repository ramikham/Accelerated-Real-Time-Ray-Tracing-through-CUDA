This scene was rendered with 3,000 samples-per-pixel. All the materials in this scene are Phong. 
Because Phong materials have a reflective component, we notice the presence of some white sprinkles scattered 
around the scene. These are not to be confused with shadow acne (which are caused by numerical precision errors); 
they are reflections of the white light in the ceiling.
