# Week 4 Tasks

**2 October - 8 October**
- #### Meet supervisor
- [x] Friday October, 6
  <br>
  <br>
- #### Implement the following features in the ray tracer:
- [x] Refactor the code
    - The shading model was dumped inside the *cst_ray()* function, while this was ok for a
      first rendering image, I think it would be wise to refactor this shading formulation into
      several classes that inherit from one class (Material.h). This will make it easier for me to define
      the scattering formulation of the different materials. This will mean that there is more separation
      in my code.
      This refactoring will also mean that I have to cheange my Sphere.h class.
- [x] Update the Camera class to allow the camera to be orientable and positionable
- [x] Update the Camera class to enable "Defocus Blur"
- [ ] Bounding Volume Hierarchies
- [ ] Axis Aligned Bounding Boxes
- [ ] Shading Model
- [ ] Light
  <br>
  <br>
- #### Test out the renderer
- [ ] Compare the speed improvement achieved to last week's version after implementing BVHs and AABBs
- [ ] Compare the visual/render quality of images rendered with different samples-per-pixel count
- [ ] Compare the visual/render quality of images rendered with different maximum recursion depth
- [ ] Compare the visual/render quality of images rendered with different shading models
- [ ] Compare the visual/render quality of images rendered with lights vs ambient light only
  <br>

- #### Start the *Literature Review*
- [x] Included 3 research papers in the LaTeX document
